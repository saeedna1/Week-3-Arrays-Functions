/*Function speakFriend:
Write a function named speakFriend that takes one parameter. Use console.log() to print the requested information to the console.
Return the string "Access Denied" Except if the passed in value is equal to "Mellon", then return "Enter"*/

//In the Instructor's Solution, an else statement was not used. Why doesn't this function return "Access Denied" every time?
// answer is //function will end once returned. Anything after will be ignored and the function will exit.

/*Function isBlue:
Create a function named isBlue. isBlue will take one parameter, and it will return true if it is passed "blue", otherwise it will return false.
The task here is to write the function isBlue.
The passed value can be "blue" with any of the letters capitalized as well. (i.e."Blue", "bLue", "BLUE", etcâ€¦) All forms of the word blue should return true. Use toLowerCase() on the passed value to accomplish this. For example, myVariable.toLowerCase() will convert whatever myVariable is to all lowercase.*/
